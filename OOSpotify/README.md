# OOSpotify

OOSpotify is an object-oriented approach to interacting with the Spotify Web API. 
It uses Paul Lamere's spotipy (https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) as its backbone for connecting to the API and has a lot of
similar functionality to some of spotipy's example functions (https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/blob/master/examples), but it
builds in the concepts of Artist, Album, Track, and Playlist objects for more intuitive operation.
